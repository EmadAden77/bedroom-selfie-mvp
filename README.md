# Bedroom Selfie MVP

Private source repository for the Subject & Clothing Prompt Preview builder.

## Import status

This initial commit preserves the source files received in `bedroom-selfie-mvp.zip`. Generated `dist/` files are excluded. The imported source is known to fail a real TypeScript check, Vite build, and Vitest collection. The original custom scripts inspect source text and do not prove that the application works.

Repairs will be prepared on a separate branch and reviewed in a draft merge request.

Scope: reference image, identity guards, hair, expressions, and clothing. Body, pose, room, lighting, and camera modules are pending.


## Ghalyon prompt optimizer

The Gemini image-prompt writer applies a Ghalyon BASIC-style intent review while preserving the existing photographic realism and physics constraints.

Within the main prompt engine, **غَليون** can also improve a raw idea or an existing generated prompt for **Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude**. Select **AUTO**, **BASIC** (no questions), or **DETAIL** (up to three high-value questions only when essential details are missing). The result shows the optimized prompt, key improvements, and a professional tip. Adopting that result for the photo audit is an explicit action.

The app keeps the idea, answers and result only in transient React state; it does not write them to localStorage, sessions or a database. Text is transmitted to Google's Gemini API for processing, so Google's data-handling terms still apply. Requests return `Cache-Control: no-store` and the server does not log prompt contents. The existing image generation flow and independent local fallback remain available.
